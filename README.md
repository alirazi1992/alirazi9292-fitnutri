## 🧩 How it works (Concept)

1. **Create a profile** — Users outline goals, preferences, and budget.

2. **Browse professionals** — Filter by specialty, experience, certifications, and price.

3. **Connect & start** — Message your match and begin a plan.

4. **Track progress** — Review and adjust over time.
